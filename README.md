JAX-RS / Jetty example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlanHohn/jaxrs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/AlanHohn/jaxrs)
======

This is a small Java project initially developed for a class on
distributed Java (mostly Java EE and Spring). 

The code consists of both a client and a webapp that provides
a trivial calculation capability to illustrate using JAX-RS
using Jersey. There's also a useful `EmbeddedServer` class that allows
the webapp to be run as a standalone Java application. The project 
can also be built as a WAR using Maven.

This project is similar to (and based on) my [Spring WebMVC][webmvc]
project.
